## Abstract

QBMMlib is an open source Mathematica package of quadrature-based moment methods and their algorithms.
Such methods are commonly used to solve fully-coupled disperse flow and combustion problems, though formulating and closing the corresponding governing equations can be complex.
QBMMlib aims to make analyzing these techniques simple and more accessible.
Its routines use symbolic manipulation to formulate the moment transport equations for a population balance equation and a prescribed dynamical system.
However, the resulting moment transport equations are unclosed.
QBMMlib trades the moments for a set of quadrature points and weights via an inversion algorithm, of which several are available.
Quadratures then closes the moment transport equations.
